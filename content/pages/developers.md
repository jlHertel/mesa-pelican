Both professional and volunteer developers contribute to Mesa.

[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) employs several of the main Mesa developers including Brian Paul and Keith Whitwell.

In the past, Tungsten Graphics contracts implemented many Mesa features including:

* DRI drivers for Intel i965, i945, i915 and other chips
* Advanced memory manager and framebuffer object support
* Shading language compiler and OpenGL 2.0 support
* MiniGLX environment

Other companies including [Intel](https://01.org/linuxgraphics)
and RedHat also actively contribute to the project.
Intel has recently contributed the new GLSL compiler in Mesa 7.9.

[LunarG](https://www.lunarg.com/) can be contacted for custom Mesa / 3D graphics development.

Volunteers have made significant contributions to all parts of Mesa, including complete device drivers.
