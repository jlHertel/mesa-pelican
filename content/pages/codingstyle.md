Title: Coding Style
slug: codingstyle

Mesa is over 20 years old and the coding style has evolved over time.
Some old parts use a style that's a bit out of date.

Different sections of mesa can use different coding style as set in the local
EditorConfig (.editorconfig) and/or Emacs (.dir-locals.el) file.

Alternatively the following is applicable.

If the guidelines below don't cover something, try following the format of
existing, neighboring code.

Basic formatting guidelines

* 3-space indentation, no tabs.

* Limit lines to 78 or fewer characters.  The idea is to prevent line
wrapping in 80-column editors and terminals.  There are exceptions, such
as if you're defining a large, static table of information.

* Opening braces go on the same line as the if/for/while statement. For example:

        :::c
        if (condition) {
           foo;
        } else {
           bar;
        }

* Put a space before/after operators.  For example, ```a = b + c;``` and not ```a=b+c;```

* This GNU indent command generally does the right thing for formatting:

        :::bash
        indent -br -i3 -npcs --no-tabs infile.c -o outfile.c

* Use comments wherever you think it would be helpful for other developers.
Several specific cases and style examples follow.  Note that we roughly
follow [Doxygen][1] conventions.

    Single-line comments:

        :::c
        /* null-out pointer to prevent dangling reference below */
        bufferObj = NULL;

    Or,

        :::c
        bufferObj = NULL;  /* prevent dangling reference below */

    Multi-line comment:

        :::c
        /* If this is a new buffer object id, or one which was generated but
         * never used before, allocate a buffer object now.
         */

    We try to quote the OpenGL specification where prudent:

        :::c
        /* Page 38 of the PDF of the OpenGL ES 3.0 spec says:
         *
         *     "An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated for any of the following
         *     conditions:
         *
         *     * <length> is zero."
         *
         * Additionally, page 94 of the PDF of the OpenGL 4.5 core spec
         * (30.10.2014) also says this, so it's no longer allowed for desktop GL,
         * either.
         */

    Function comment example:

        :::c
        /**
         * Create and initialize a new buffer object.  Called via the
         * ctx->Driver.CreateObject() driver callback function.
         * \param  name  integer name of the object
         * \param  type  one of GL_FOO, GL_BAR, etc.
         * \return  pointer to new object or NULL if error
         */
        struct gl_object *
        _mesa_create_object(GLuint name, GLenum type)
        {
           /* function body */
        }

* Put the function return type and qualifiers on one line and the function
name and parameters on the next, as seen above.  This makes it easy to use
```grep ^function_name dir/*``` to find function definitions.  Also,
the opening brace goes on the next line by itself (see above.)

* Function names follow various conventions depending on the type of function:

        :::text
        glFooBar()       - a public GL entry point (in glapi_dispatch.c)
        _mesa_FooBar()   - the internal immediate mode function
        save_FooBar()    - retained mode (display list) function in dlist.c
        foo_bar()        - a static (private) function
        _mesa_foo_bar()  - an internal non-static Mesa function

* Constants, macros and enum names are ALL_UPPERCASE, with _ between words.

* Mesa usually uses camel case for local variables (Ex: "localVarname")
while gallium typically uses underscores (Ex: "local_var_name").

* Global variables are almost never used because Mesa should be thread-safe.

* Booleans.  Places that are not directly visible to the GL API
should prefer the use of ```bool```, ```true```, and
```false``` over ```GLboolean```, ```GL_TRUE```, and
```GL_FALSE```.  In C code, this may mean that
```#include <stdbool.h>``` needs to be added.  The
```try_emit_```* methods in src/mesa/program/ir_to_mesa.cpp and
src/mesa/state_tracker/st_glsl_to_tgsi.cpp can serve as examples.
